# Sentinel – Personal AI OS Daemon

A modular, intelligent assistant that observes your digital behavior, reflects on it to provide insights and acts autonomously — all under your control.

# What is Sentinel?

Sentinel is a local-first AI OS that runs quietly on your machine like a daemon. It watches your app usage, browser activity, GitHub commits, and engagement levels. Then, it reflects on these patterns to give you structured, intelligent suggestions — and can act on them via safe, user-approved automation.

It's your personal AI assistant who never forgets, never judges, and always respects your autonomy.

# Core Philosophy

Autonomous, but never out of control

Reflective, not intrusive

Modular, extensible, and hackable

Offline-first, private by default

# Architecture

Sentinel works in three stages, each with modular subsystems:

### Observe

Track how you spend time across your digital workspace.

<b> App Monitor </b> – App name, window title, focus time, duration

<b> Browser Monitor </b> – Websites visited, tab titles, time spent

<b> Github Monitor </b> – Repo activity, commits, coding patterns

<b> Input Monitor </b> – Keyboard, mouse, idle detection

### Reflect

Suggest ways to improve routine, focus, work-life balance.

<b> Routine Suggestions </b> – App habits, idle recovery

<b> Professional Suggestions </b> – GitHub rhythm, stale projects

<b> Productivity Suggestions </b> – Focus blocks, work hours

<b> Personal Suggestions </b> – Work-life balance, self-awareness

### Act

Execute useful actions within safe, structured boundaries.

<b> Intent Parser </b> – Accepts LLM-generated suggestions

<b> Automation Builder </b> – Builds structured trigger objects

# Privacy and Ethics

Sentinel runs locally. No cloud sync. No telemetry. You own your data.

Future extensions may support optional encrypted syncing and plugin system.
